## 1: Naming is a hard problem

Before you start, you must choose a **good** name for your project.
Basic rules for getting a good name is as follow.
Use hyphen to separate words. Only non-cap letters or numbers allowed. Don't start with a number or hyphen.
Two or more contiguous hyphens is forbidden. No trailing hypens.

Some examples of good project names:
```
hello-robot
advanced-drone-controller
ele115-assignment-1
```

Some examples of bad project names:
```
untitled
myfirstproject
project123
```

## 2: Use the project templete

Whenver you have a *good* name for your project, you can begin with the following:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
1. Click `Create New Project`.
1. In the left panel, select `User-defined`.
1. In the right panel, select `ELE115`.
1. Click `Next`.

**Note:** If you don't see `User-defined`, checkout
[Setup Guide 3.2: Download ELE115 project template](https://github.com/ELE115/docs/blob/master/setup.md#32-download-ele115-project-template).

You should now see the IntelliJ IDEA workspace fully unwinded for you.
But don't panic, and **don't touch anywhere** for now.
Follow the instructions.

**Note:** If you see `Tips of the day` dialog, simply click `Close`.

**Note:** Please do **NOT** click `Import Gradle Project` for now.
If you did, quit IntelliJ IDEA, delete your project, and start over from the beginning.

## 3: Edit Gradle files

To the left there is `Project` panel, in which you can see a list of files:

* `.editorconfig`: Specifies your coding style - what is allowed and what is forbidden. *You don't need to touch it.*
* `.gitignore`: What files should belongs to your program and what should not. *You don't need to touch it.*
* `build.gradle`: This is the most important configuration file, denoting some key characteristics of your program: **You MUST modify this file**
  * Which language is your program written in?
  * Who wrote the program?
  * Where should the program start running?
  * Does the program depend on other programs? What are they? Where can I find them?
* `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`: These are auxiliary programs that reads `build.gradle` and compiles your program. *You don't need to touch it.*
  * `gradlew` is for Linux and Mac OS users.
  * `gradlew.bat` is for Windows users.
* `settings.gradle`: This file records your program's name. **You MUST modify this file**.
* `External Libraries`: This is *NOT* an actual file nor folder. IntelliJ IDEA will be listing all your dependencies here. *You don't need to touch it.*
* `Scratches and Consoles`: This is *NOT* an actual file nor folder. IntelliJ IDEA allows you to store unused files here. *You don't need to touch it.*

We need to manually modify some files before we can proceed.
So follow the instructions:

**Note:** If you see `Non-Project Files Protection` dialog, simply click `OK`.

1. In file `settings.gradle`, replace `<your-project-name>` with your project name.
1. In file `build.gradle`, replace ALL occurancess of `<your_project_name>` with your project name,
but **using underscores instead of hyphens** to separate words.
1. In file `build.gradle`, replace ALL occurancess of `<your_netid>` with your netid.
No capital characters.

## 4: Import Gradle Project

So now all Gradle-related stuffs are ready.
At the bottom right corner of your workspace, there should be a box titled `IntelliJ IDEA found a Gradle build script`.
In the box, click the `Import Gradle Project`.

This process may take seconds to minutes to execute.
What is happening is that `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat` is being executed and `build.gradle` is parsed.
Gradle noticed that you are willing to use Tello controller libraries,
so it is actively downloading it for you.
The controller is, unfortunately, gigantic in its size: 800MiB in total!
No wonder why it takes so long to download.

Just sit and wait for the process to finish.

**Note:** If you accidentally clicked `Skip` or closed the small box or just can't find such box, don't worry!
There is a small magnifier icon at the top right corner of your workspace.
Click the magnifier, and type `Import Gradle Project`.
Hit enter and that it! Just wait for it to finish.

After several minutes (or a fraction of second if this is not the very first time),
you should notice two things:

* To the right, there is a new panel `Gradle` popped up. **You need to make changes in it.**
* To the left, your `Project` panel has changed. Files are grouped together.
New files and folders appear:
  * `.gradle` folder: this is where Gradle put some temporary files. *You don't need to touch it.*
  * `.idea` folder: this is where IntelliJ IDEA put its files in. *You don't need to touch it.*
  * `build` folder (you may not see it now, but you will see it soon): this is where Gradle put its output files in. *You don't need to touch it.*
  * `gradle` folder: internal settings for Gradle are stored here. *You don't need to touch it.*
  * `src/main/java` folder: **Here is where you should put your program files in!**

We start with the `Gradle` panel.

1. Click on the triangle before your project (should be the only item) in the `Gradle` panel.
1. Find `<your-project-name>`/`Tasks`/`application`/`run`.
1. Right click on it, and choose `Create '<your-project-name> [run]'...`.
1. Don't change any thing in the popped up dialog, simply click `OK`.
1. It's advisable to minimize the `Gradle` panel, since you will never use it anymore.
Just click the minus sign at the top right corner of the panel to minimize it.

## 5: Start programming and have fun

Congratulations!
All your configurations have completed, we can commence coding!

1. In `Project` panel, unfold `<your-project-name>`.
1. In `Project` panel, right-click on the folder `src/main/java`, click `New`/`Java Class`.
1. In the `New Java Class` dialog, fill in `Name` field by `com.github.ele115.<your_netid>.<your_project_name>.Main`.
Remember, `<your_project_name>` should use underscores instead of hyphens to separate words.

Start writing your program now!

Whenver you want to execute your program,
simply hit `Shift+F10`,
or click the little green triangle at the top right corner of your workspace.
IntelliJ IDEA will launch `gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`, which will do the following:

* Parse `build.gradle`, understand what's going on
* Download newly added dependencies for you (if you request more)
* Compile your program
* Execute your program from the specified entrance

At the bottom you can see the output of Gradle, middle of which is your program's output.
